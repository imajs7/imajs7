### Hi there 👋

![](https://github.com/imajs7/imajs7/blob/main/my-git-cover.png)




I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making contributing to open-source more approachable, creating problem solving technology, and building a community of enthusiast tech-learners. Some technologies I enjoy working with include ReactJS, Jamstack (JavaScript, APIs + Markup) and GraphQL. In 2020, I started a tech company <a href="https://jsmedia7.in/">JSMedia7 - Web Solutions</a> to build effective end user web apps.
